## I am a demo window !!

*Wanna play with me ?*

### Controls

Well, as you would expect from a window, you can move it by dragging it from its title bar, and you can resize it from any of either its 4 edges or its 4 corners.

At the top right corner, there are the basic controls anyone would expect, so in this order : minimize, maximize (or restore), and close.
You can also double click on the title bar to maximize it, and when maximize, double click on its title bar to restore it. By clicking on the associated tab, you can minimize/restore the window.

### Management

Windows are managed outside of the page content. That way, you can have windows opened while navigating through the app. Internally, it uses a store to keep track of all changes, this store being accessible by everything in the application.
