# Semstrap demo

This repository contains the source code of the Semstrap demo available [here](https://github.com/GoverAnter/semstrap-demo).

## Main idea

This demo is here to show how the Semstrap framework works, how it can be used, and how it can be useful.

I strongly recommend to read the *Know more* sections in each pages, and the main *About this demo* to have the greater picture.

## How to build it

Well, you can't, because it needs private dependencies (the `@inveasy/semstrap` framework).

## How to contribute

Don't. You can't !
I love the fact that i hate companies that open sourced the less interesting part of their software, and i just did the same !

## Licence

MIT. You can't use anything interesting in this demo anyway...
Except for the markdown part ? ;p
